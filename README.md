# CPU Scheduling Simulator

This Java application simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms, allowing the user to input process details and visualize the scheduling results. The supported algorithms are:

- Round Robin
- Non-Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Non-Preemptive Priority

## Features

1. **Scheduler Selection**: The user can choose a scheduling algorithm from a list.
2. **Process Input**: The user inputs the number of processes (between 3 and 10) and the details for each process, including arrival time, burst time, and priority.
3. **Scheduling Execution**: Based on the selected algorithm, the simulator schedules the processes and calculates the necessary metrics.
4. **Results Display**: The results are displayed in a table and a Gantt chart, including metrics like turnaround time and waiting time.<br><br>
